      **Alanna Dailey - I’ve Got To Use My Imagination**


      Alanna is a talented singer raised here in Port Townsend. She started
      singing classic jazz and old blues at an early age and was mentored by
      some of our town's finest musicians including Pete Toyne and Jenny Davis.
      Alanna finished tracking all of her parts for an eclectic album we
      recorded in the summer of 2015 before she moved to France. This is the
      first track completed and has a video to go with it.

      **Tyva Kyzy - Ayak Shaiym (My Bowl Of Tea)**


      These five women flew from Tuva to Port Townsend to make this recording
      and then do a west coast tour. They spoke little English, I spoke no Tuvan
      and we just set up and worked for 5 days. I mixed and mastered while they
      were on the tour, taking orders for the CD along the way. At the end of
      the tour we delivered the finished CD's. It was a delightful experience.

      **The Blackberry Bushes - Cluck Old Hen**


      The BB’s came by the studio to film a video for their tour promotion. This
      was the highlight tune. They played around a single main mic with 2 side
      fill mics for solos and got a great honest 'in the room' sound. The video
      can be seen here: youtu.be/9VdG1oicOBA And find out more about them here:
