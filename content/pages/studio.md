testimonial: >-
  “Recording at ToolShed SoundLab was an exceptionally easy and satisfying
  experience, and after four decades of making records, that's really saying
  something! The room itself is a great-sounding space, high ceilings and with
  many instruments hanging on the walls. George got great sounds on all of our
  many different acoustic instruments, the best we've had for a long, long time;
  taking the time to really listen and adjust until each miking setup was
  optimized for its particular instruments. His experience as a luthier makes
  him extra-attuned to the sounds of the instruments. George is so easy to work
  with - friendly, professional, relaxed, and an excellent communicator. Even
  the rough mixes sound good!” - Eric and Suzy Thompson

  ## Remote Recording


  I offer remote recording utilizing a Universal Audio Apollo 8 and Vintech 473
  Neve style 4 channel Mic Pre. Please inquire about availability and rates.


  Although I do have modern digital recording equipment, my goal is to produce
  music the good old fashioned way, where the music comes first; as live and
  direct as possible - I’m an analog guy in a digital world.


  If you are interested in having me produce and/or record your project please
  contact me for details. I am always happy to discuss pre-production needs and
  concerns. [Contact me](/contact)
