  I first became interested in guitar making at the age of 16.


  Soon after I quit school and lucked into a job at Guild Guitars. (I dated the
  ownerâ€™s grand-daughter in high school.) Since 1975 I have been building,
  repairing and restoring musical instruments of the fretted variety.


  I currently operate the repair shop at Crossroads Music in Port Townsend and
  am available for consultation regarding your instrument's needs.


  Call me at 360-385-1471 to set an appointment, or send a message via the
  Contact Form.


  If your instrument is hard to play, it needs help. I can adjust it to make
  your playing time more enjoyable.
