      This version of Pastures of Plenty, my favorite Woody Guthrie tune, was
      recorded during a session for the Smithsonian-Folkways tribute album
      titled ‘Roll Columbia’ but was not intended for the CD. My version of The
      Song of the Grand Coulee Dam was included on the CD. Produced by my good
      friend Joe Seamons, it features many North-West musicians. David and Tracy
      Grisman accompanied me on mandolin and bass on both tunes.


      **Notes from Smithsonian**: Roll Columbia: Woody Guthrie’s 26 Northwest
      Songs is a trove of new discoveries, and a celebration of Guthrie’s genius
      and lasting contributions to both the history and musical traditions of
      the Pacific Northwest. In 1941, the Bonneville Power Administration
      commissioned Guthrie to write songs to help promote to the public the
      construction of dams along the Columbia River.
