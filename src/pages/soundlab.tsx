          “Recording at ToolShed SoundLab was an exceptionally easy and
          satisfying experience, and after four decades of making records,
          that's really saying something! The room itself is a great-sounding
          space, high ceilings and with many instruments hanging on the walls.
          George got great sounds on all of our many different acoustic
          instruments, the best we've had for a long, long time; taking the time
          to really listen and adjust until each miking setup was optimized for
          its particular instruments. His experience as a luthier makes him
          extra-attuned to the sounds of the instruments. George is so easy to
          work with - friendly, professional, relaxed, and an excellent
          communicator. Even the rough mixes sound good!” Eric and Suzy Thompson

          Although I do have modern digital recording equipment, my goal is to
          produce music the good old fashioned way, where the music comes first;
          as live and direct as possible - I’m an analog guy in a digital world.

          If you are interested in having me produce and/or record your project

            the ceiling for the studio control room was built by Niels Holm
