            Soon after I quit school and lucked into a job at Guild Guitars. (I
            dated the ownerâ€™s grand-daughter in high school). Since 1975 I have
            been building, repairing and restoring musical instruments of the
            fretted variety.

            I currently operate the repair shop at Crossroads Music in Port
            Townsend and am available for consultation regarding your
