          <p>I first became interested in guitar making at the age of 16.</p>
          <p>
            Soon after I quit school and lucked into a job at Guild Guitars. (I
            dated the ownerâ€™s grand-daughter in high school.) Since 1975 I have
            been building, repairing and restoring musical instruments of the
            fretted variety.
          </p>
          <p>
            I currently operate the repair shop at Crossroads Music in Port
            Townsend and am available for consultation regarding your
            instrument's needs.
          </p>
          <p>
            Call me at 360-385-1471 to set an appointment, or send a message via
            the <a href="/contact">Contact Form</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If your instrument is hard to play, it needs help. I can adjust it
            to make your playing time more enjoyable.
